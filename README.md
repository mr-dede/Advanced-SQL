# Advanced-SQL

In this repository, I showcase a collection of exercises undertaken to enhance my proficiency in SQL. Employing the Microsoft AdventureWorks database and Microsoft Management Studio as the database manager, I delved into various topics, including:

1. Advanced filtering using EXISTS and NOT EXISTS.
2. Flattening data through PIVOT operations.
3. Generating data series employing Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
4. Harnessing the power of CTEs and temporary tables to simplify complex processes into manageable steps.
5. Defining and manipulating tables using Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands.
6. Designing lookup tables to streamline redundant analysis.
7. SQL optimization techniques, encompassing the use of indexes.
8. Procedural programming techniques such as variables and IF statements.
9. Crafting custom SQL functions for specific requirements.
10. Creating stored procedures to facilitate flexible and repeatable analysis.
11. Elevating SQL knowledge through procedural programming techniques like variables and IF statements.
12. Crafting code that dynamically generates SQL through Dynamic SQL.
